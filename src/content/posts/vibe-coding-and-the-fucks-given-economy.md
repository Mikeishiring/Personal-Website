## Claim

I'm both terrified and excited by the progression of AI.

## Evidence

Last month, out of spite to prove a friend wrong, I started vibe coding.

Two to three weeks later, that turned into:

[Closing Table](https://closing-table.pages.dev): how could we agree on a number without negotiating? One-shot double blind auction with separate links. It didn't work because making it fair breaks privacy.

[Spam Game](https://spam-game.onrender.com): a competitive multiplayer game to visualize timing games. Multiplayer mode was a new challenge but the sound when you click is addictive.

Talent Intelligence Platform (in progress): scraping crypto jobs, GitHub, and market narratives to infer what everyone is saying about themselves and the market—basically over-the-top micro data science for talent in crypto.

## Implication

Jobs will change. We're heading toward everyone being an expert advisor to their bot army—judged by taste and "how much they gave a fuck."

## Next test

I'm going to keep shipping weekly: small tools, sharper viewpoints, and better maps of what the talent market is actually doing.
