Resumes optimize for past performance, not future potential. They reward people who've already had opportunities and punish those who haven't.

## The resume trap

When you screen by resume, you're selecting for:
- Pedigree (school, previous companies)
- Longevity (years of experience)
- Keywords (technologies, frameworks)

What you're missing:
- How they think
- How they learn
- How they collaborate

## A better signal

The best hires I've made came from work samples, not resumes. Give candidates a problem similar to what they'd actually solve. Watch how they approach it.

You learn more from 2 hours of real work than from 10 years of resume bullet points.

## Making it work

**Keep it small.** Don't ask for a week-long project. Ask for something that takes 2-3 hours max.

**Pay for it.** Respect their time. This is work, not a favor.

**Make it realistic.** Don't create artificial problems. Use real challenges your team faces.

The goal isn't to find perfect candidates. It's to find people who think the way you need them to think.
